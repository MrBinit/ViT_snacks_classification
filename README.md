Snack Classifier using Vision Transformer
Project Overview
This project involves developing a classifier to identify the names of various snacks using images. The model leverages a Vision Transformer and is implemented with PyTorch.

Features
Model Architecture: Vision Transformer
Framework: PyTorch
Purpose: Classify snack images accurately
Getting Started
Prerequisites
